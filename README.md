# Wasted

One man’s trash is another man’s treasure . . . literally if you’re using Wasted. Wasted is the one-stop app for college students to anonymously get rid of whatever, whenever. Leave the item at a popular campus location, take a quick pic, and post for your fellow classmates or university staff to combat waste generation and make their days slightly better. From over-ordering catering to that unwanted desk while moving out, get rid of wasted potential with Wasted.


## MVP 🎯

- User account registration and authentication
- Users receive notifications when someone from their university has posted a time-sensitive item
- Users are able to upload/take a picture of an unwanted item & caption details of item’s pickup location
  - Posts are anonymous
  - Integrated camera
  - User can also choose picture from camera roll
- “Track” feature on each post, so that users get directions to the building where the item is left
- Post auto-delete once the item has been claimed
- Public comments from anonymous users under each post for item clarification


## Stretch Goals 🏁

- Feed is based on urgency (time/date)
- “Seeking” Screen, where users are able to post items they are in need of
- Direct message original poster about item status
